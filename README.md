# ICE 2: Half-Adder

Code for [ECE 281 ICE 2: Half-Adder](https://usafa-ece.github.io/ece281-book/ICE/ICE2.html)

Targeted toward Digilent Basys3. Make sure to install the [board files](https://github.com/Xilinx/XilinxBoardStore/tree/2018.2/boards/Digilent/basys3).

Tested on Windows 11 using Vivado 2024.

## GitHub Actions Testbench

The workflow uses the [setup-ghdl-ci](https://github.com/ghdl/setup-ghdl-ci) GitHub action
to run a *nightly* build of [GHDL](https://ghdl.github.io/ghdl/).

First, the workflow uses GHDL to **analyze** all `.vhd` files in `src/hdl/`.

Then it **elaborates** the *any* entity with the name `*_tb`. In this case, that is `helloled_tb`.

Finally, the workflow **runs** the simulation. If successful then it will quietly exit with a `0` code.
If any of the `assert` statements fail **with** `severity failure` then GHDL will cease the simulation and exit with non-zero code; this will also cause the workflow to fail.
Assert statements of other severity levels will be reported, but not fail the workflow.

Documentation Statement:
C3C Kate Unger helped me with finding the correct button to open the schematic generated by the Vivado Synthesis function. She also helped me by explaining that signals in part where we modify the test bench have to be set to 0 for them to work. I watched a Youtube video on how to commit in git bash (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DHjfDuXMGA).
